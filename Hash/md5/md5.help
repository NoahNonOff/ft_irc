variable length -> 128 bit output

input broken up into blocks (chunks) of 16 words (32 bit)

padding -> same as sha-256

operation on 128 bit state -> 4 words of 32 bit [A, B, C, D] -> initialized to constant

the block will modify the state

the state has the same effect as sha256

4 round / block && 16 op / round
